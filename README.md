# GridWorld

Implementation of Policy iteration and Value iteration to help agent make decisions in GridWorld. Problem was introduced in [Artificial Intelligence - A modern approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

A nice explanation, math equations, pseudo code of value and policy iteration can be found [here](https://medium.com/@m.alzantot/deep-reinforcement-learning-demysitifed-episode-2-policy-iteration-value-iteration-and-q-978f9e89ddaa) <- some online reference
